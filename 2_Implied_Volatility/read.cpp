//Volatility = what happened(How much the asset actually moved in the past)
//σ=Std Dev of returns
//Implied Volatility = What market expects(How much the market expects the asset to move in the future)
//It is derived from option prices using models like:Black-Scholes model

//////Implied volatality
//1.Black-scholes model + design pattern + function objects


////Interval Bisection
//It makes use of a real analysis concept known as the intermediate value theorem. Since the Black-Scholes formula is continuous. we can make use of the theorem to help us find a volatility.




/////Newton-Raphson and Brent's Method
